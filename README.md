# Logical Zoom

This is a simple Minecraft Fabic mod that adds a configurable zoom key.

There are other mods that have this same feature but this is my first mod and I'm using this as an excuse to learn Minecraft modding.

By default the C key is mapped for zooming (as with Optifine) but you can change this in the Controls settings of Minecraft.

## Installation

1. Download and install Fabric from here: https://fabricmc.net/use
2. Download Fabric API mod from here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and place in your mods folder.
3. Download Logical Zoom from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/logical-zoom or https://modrinth.com/mod/logical-zoom and place in your mods folder.
4. Start Minecraft and go to Options > Controls > Logical Zoom to change the hotkey.

This is a client-side mod and so doesn't require Fabric on the server.

## Updating for new Minecraft version

1. Visit https://fabricmc.net/develop/ for latest settings
2. Paste settings into `gradle.properties` and increase mod version
3. Check `fabric.mod.json` is using the correct target version of Minecraft and `fabricloader`
4. Run `.\gradlew vscode`
5. F5 and test the mod is working
6. Run `.\gradlew build`
7. Publish /build/libs/logical_zoom-x.jar

If there is a loom version error at 4 above, update `build.gradle` with the latest version from the example mod template here: https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod/blob/master/build.gradle
